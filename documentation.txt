comp location is top right corner for first output pin, matches first input pin's y, first input pin x = first output pin x - comp width
every subsequent pin is the same as the one above it + pins diff
comp width: 220(x)
pins diff: 20(y)

Order of pins is based on y top to bottom

check non comp elements sizes: gates/splitters
